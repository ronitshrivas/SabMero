    // NOTE: There is intentionally NO Role property here. Role is an
    // authorization attribute and must be assigned by the server, never
    // chosen by the client. Public registration always creates a Customer;
    // privileged roles are created only through their controlled flows:
    //   Vendor      → POST /api/Vendors/register + admin approval
    //   Staff/Tech/Rider → POST /api/admin/staff (admin only)
    //   Admin       → seeded in the database
    // If a client still sends "role" in the JSON body it is silently
    // ignored by the model binder, so old app versions keep working.
